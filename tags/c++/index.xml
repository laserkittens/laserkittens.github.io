      <description>My journey thus far I began programming in middle school in BASIC on a Radio Shack TRS-80 (&amp;ldquo;Trash 80&amp;rdquo;) that ran using two 5.25&amp;rdquo; floppy disks (to be fair, you pretty much had to learn BASIC in order to use the thing). I’m not that old, we simply didn’t have much money growing up so I got ancient computers from places like the Goodwill (the kind that were so old and junky people literally gave them away).</description>
